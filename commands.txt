1. 
    minikube start --driver=docker

2. 
    minikube status

finding an ip address which was assigned by kubernetes. 
3. minikube ip
192.168.49.2

4. No need pass an ip address.
    minikube ssh
--------------------------------------------------------
5.
Default password for the minikube node user credentials:
    Username: docker
    Password: tcuser

6. 
    kubectl cluster-info

7. 
    kubectl get nodes -> gives available nodes. 

8. 
    kubectl get pods -> gives available pods. 

9. Used to group different resources.
    kubectl get namespaces

10. List systems pods which are running in master node:
    kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system

11. Creating 
    kubectl run nginx --image=nginx

12. 
    kubectl describe pod nginx 

13. 
    minikube ssh

14. 
    docker ps | grep nginx

15. Connecting two container. 
docker exec -it da4c1d2d89df sh
    # hostname
        nginx
    # hostname -i
        10.244.0.3
    # curl 10.244.0.3
        Gives html code. 

16. Existing from connections:
    logout

17. 
    kubectl get pods -o wide

18. Delete pods. 
    kubectl delete pod nginx

19. Checking. 
    kubectl get pods

20. Creating an alias of kubectl command. 
    alias k="kubectl"

21. Creating deployment:
    k create deployment nginx-deployment --image=nginx

22. Getting the deployment:
k get deployments

23. 
    k describe deployment nginx-deployment

# Note:- Selector are used to connect the deployment with pods. 
# In kubernetes, pods and deployment are separate object so that selector comes into a Picture.

24. 
    k describe pods nginx-deployment-6cfb98644c-2rdjb

25. scaling deployment. 
    k scale deployment nginx-deployment --replicas=5

26. k get pods

27. Accessing all the pods with IP address. 
    k get pods -o wide

28. Now, Let's Connect two pod. 
    curl ip_address

29. 
(base) nydvc ~ % minikube ip
192.168.49.2
(base) ydvc ~ % minikube ssh
docker@minikube:~$ 

30. Exposing internal port to external. 
    k expose deployment nginx-deployment --port=8080 --target-port=80


31. Extracting the services: svc((short version of services))
    k get svc

# Cluster ip address is not available outside of the kubernetes cluster. 

32. Accessing the particular service. 
    k describe service nginx-deployment
